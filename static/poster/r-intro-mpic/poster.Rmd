## *What* is this

This is an anouncement of a 4.5-hour course for:

  - beginners without progamming background,
  - students and early career scientists who are interested in R, and 
  - senior scientists who are interested in reproducible research.

This poster was created via R. It is reproducible, accessible online, and interactive (try the demo data table below). Wanna know how? Come and join us!

## *When* and *where*

- Seminar Room on the first floor at Max Planck Institute for Chemistry.
- Tuesday (4^*th*^ Dec. 2018) afternoon and Wednesday (5^*th*^ Dec.) morning.


## *How* to participate
