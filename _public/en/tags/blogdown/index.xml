      <description>This post is presenting two achievements by bookdown.
The first one is a paper book I wrote: Learning R: R for Rookies (in Chinese). It was published in May 2018 in Mainland China by the Research Publishing Press. I guess it must be the first ever published paper book written in Chinese and built in the bookdown environment. Hooray!
I tried using MS Word at the beginning but I failed. The publishing press tried using Adobe InDesign for typesetting and publishing this book but failed as well.</description>
