      <description>At the beginning of July, Kathi and I went to the Aosta Valley to set up the advection measurement at Torgnon. Thanks a lot to Marta and other colleagues!
Our institute is collecting post cards from the fieldwork in the meanwhile. Here is one from us.</description>

      <description>This week we used the excellent weather conditions for a group hike.
After we had figured out where actually to go,
… and some involved grass scrambling
… we finally reached our “summit”, where we took a well-deserved break
… and marveled the gorgeous view.
“What goes up must come down” and so we eventually returned back and cooled down with a beer or two,
… replenished the burnt calories,</description>
