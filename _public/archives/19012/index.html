<p>2009年夏，我刚刚出国读书，被系里临时安排在交流学者的办公室。办公室书架上，竖着几本书无人认领，我就顺手牵羊拿走了唯一的一本英文书。此书叫做《English Grammar in Use》，作者是Raymond Murphy，剑桥大学出版社1985年第一版，1988年第八次印刷。扉页上还印着“仅在俄罗斯和乌克兰出售”。20年前的书，难怪闻起来一股古董味。</p>

<p><img src="http://pzhao.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/20170119_090819.jpg" alt="enter image description here" /></p>

<p>随手翻了一下，我立刻被吸引住了。这本全部用英文写的语法书，我竟能轻松读懂，顿时很有成就感。书的副标题是“给中级学生的自学参考和练习书”，我不知道自己的水平算不算得上中级，但里面很多小语法点是我的弱项，值得好好学习。此书对语法点没有过多解释，主要是举例子，点到为止，甚合我意。随便摊开，左面一页是语法点和示例，右面一页是习题，两页就是一个单元。每个单元独立成篇，全书共130个单元。前15个单元的习题已经被人用笔写满了，从第16单元，字迹戛然而止。</p>

<p>“虎头蛇尾的家伙。”我暗笑。当时我想，每天做一个单元，5分钟都用不了，那么四个月之后就全部搞定。书从印刷到现在都20年了，书的主人竟然没做完？真瞧不起这种没有自制力的人。</p>

<p><img src="http://pzhao.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/20170119_1114012.jpg" alt="enter image description here" /></p>

<p>2016年冬，7年多过去了，我……我总算把这本外语书吭哧吭哧读完了。比较一下，大娃京生，7年前只会中文叫“爸爸”，现在能流利地用中文和德语进行日常交流；二娃德生，7年前还在这世上不存在，现在能用中文说“爸爸，你走开，我喜欢妈妈”。而我读一本外语书花了7年多。好吧，自己正是自己瞧不起的那种缺乏自制力的人。</p>

<p>据说，这本书是世界上最受欢迎的中级英语自学语法书。多年来一版再版，甚至还出了配套光盘以及手机上的app。最新版是<a href="http://www.cambridge.org/us/cambridgeenglish/catalog/grammar-vocabulary-and-pronunciation/english-grammar-use-4th-edition" target="_blank">第四版</a>，共145个单元，彩色，比我手头这本上世纪80年代黑白印刷的、印刷错误比比皆是的旧书帅多了。我们来感受一下21世纪的时代气息：</p>

<p><img src="http://pzhao.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/EGU_cover_9780521189392.jpg" alt="enter image description here" /></p>

<p><img src="http://pzhao.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/EnglishGrammarInUse_Unit2.jpg" alt="enter image description here" /></p>

<p>而且，网上竟然可以下载得到（点击下载<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1UPVH99Sq1hQ0VDbWVKU2RNU00/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">pdf版</a>、<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B1UPVH99Sq1hcXRvVkhkU3ZaTDA" target="_blank">含光盘版</a>）。此外，该书作者为这本中级语法书写了个姊妹篇给初级用户，叫Essential Grammar in Use（<a href="https://www.google.at/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;ved=0ahUKEwifiJ-N-s3RAhVHbhQKHSRSBPIQFggwMAI&amp;url=http://ilsclasses.com/Essential%2520Grammar%2520in%2520Use.pdf&amp;usg=AFQjCNGatetwHPdmIiGvotqxbR70mWcgBg&amp;sig2=kguQWj2oCGx8uLaVkOVwkA&amp;bvm=bv.144224172,d.bGs" target="_blank">点击下载</a>）。</p>

<p>这么好的英语书，为什么我年轻时没有接触到？</p>

<p>下面，是我摘录的难点笔记，加上了我的简单注解。一边做笔记一边想，什么中级英语，难度不及我国高考，跟入门级德语的难度相比，更是被完爆……</p>

<h1 id="english-grammar-in-use">English Grammar in Use</h1>

<p>by Raymond Murphy</p>

<h3 id="present-tense-with-a-future-meaning-现在时表将来">Present tense with a future meaning 现在时表将来</h3>

<p>When you are talking about what you have already arranged to do, use the present continuous (<strong>I am doing</strong>) or <strong>going to do</strong>. Do not use <strong>will</strong>.</p>

<ul>
<li>What are you <strong>doing</strong> tomorrow? (<em>not</em> &#8216;what will you do&#8217;)</li>
<li>What are you <strong>going to do</strong> tomorrow?</li>
</ul>

<p>We use the present simple when talking about timetables, programs etc. (for public transportation, cinemas)</p>

<ul>
<li>The concert this evening <strong>starts</strong> at 7:30.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="going-to-will">Going to, will</h3>

<p>We use <strong>going to</strong> in this way when we say what we think will happen. 确定将要发生的事情。</p>

<ul>
<li>Look at those black clouds! It&#8217;s going to rain.</li>
<li>Oh, I feel terrible. I think I am going to be sick.</li>
</ul>

<p>We use <strong>will</strong> when we decide to do something at the time of speaking.</p>

<ul>
<li>Oh, I&#8217;ve left the door open. I&#8217;ll go and shut it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Do not use <strong>will</strong> to say what someone has already decided to do or arranged to do.</p>

<ul>
<li>I can&#8217;t meet you tomorrow because my parents are coming to see me. (<em>not</em> &#8216;my parents will come&#8217;)</li>
</ul>

<p>临时起意的计划用will，有“愿意”的意思；蓄谋已久的计划用going to。</p>

<p>We often use <strong>will (you) be doing</strong> to ask about people&#8217;s plan, especially when we want something or want someone to do something.</p>

<ul>
<li>&#8216;Will you be using your bicycle this evening?&#8217; &#8216;No, you can take it.&#8217;</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="present-perfect-现在完成时">Present perfect 现在完成时</h3>

<p>We often use the present perfect (<strong>I have done</strong>) to give new information or to announce a recent happening.</p>

<ul>
<li>I&#8217;ve lost my key. Can you help me look for it?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Yet</strong> shows that the speaker is ecpecting sth. to hapen.</p>

<ul>
<li>Has it stopped raining yet?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="present-perfect-continuous-现在完成进行时">Present perfect continuous 现在完成进行时</h3>

<p>We use the present perfect continuous (<strong>I have been doing</strong>) when we talk about an action which began in the past and has recently stopped or just stopped or is still happening. 过去开始，最近刚刚结束，或者尚未结束、尚在进行。</p>

<ul>
<li>You&#8217;re out of breath. Have you been running?</li>
<li>It is still raining. It has been raining for two hours. (how long, for, since)</li>
</ul>

<p>We use the present perfect continuous (<strong>I have been doing</strong>) when we are interested in the action. It does not matter whether something has been finished or not. We use the present perfect (<strong>I have done</strong>) when we are interested in the result of the action, not in the action itself. 现在完成进行时关注动作本身，不关心动作是否结束。相反，现在完成时关注动作的结果，不关注动作本身。</p>

<ul>
<li>Tom&#8217;s hands are very dirty. He has been repairing the car.</li>
<li>The car is going again now. Tom has repaired it.</li>
</ul>

<p>We use the present perfect continuous (<strong>I have been doing</strong>) for situations over a short time. We use the present perfect (<strong>I have done</strong>) for situations that exist for a longer time. 现在完成进行时用在短时间的情况，现在完成时用于长时间的情况。</p>

<ul>
<li>John has been living in London since January.</li>
<li>John has always lived in London.</li>
</ul>

<p>Do not use the present simple (<strong>I do</strong>) or continuous (<strong>I am doing</strong>) to say how long something has been happening. 表述某件事情发生了多久时，用完成时，不用一般时或进行时。</p>

<ul>
<li>I have been waiting here for an hour. (<em>not</em> &#8216;I am waiting&#8217;)</li>
</ul>

<p>But:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>How long is it since</strong> you had a holiday?</li>
<li><strong>It is ages since</strong> Tom visited us.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="may-might-can-need-should-would-will">May, might, can, need, should, would, will</h3>

<p>We use <strong>may/might as well</strong> to say that we should do something but only because there is no reason not to do it and because there is nothing better to do. 我觉得相当于had better。中文可以翻译成“还是”。</p>

<ul>
<li>You&#8217;ll have to wait an hour for the next bus, so you might as well walk.</li>
<li>We may as well go to the party. We&#8217;ve nothing else to do.</li>
<li>&#8216;Shall we have dinner now?&#8217; &#8216;We might as well.&#8217;</li>
</ul>

<p>To give permission, we use <strong>can</strong> or <strong>may</strong> (but <em>not</em> <strong>could</strong>).</p>

<ul>
<li>You can/may smoke if you like.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Can</strong> has only two forms: <strong>can</strong> and <strong>could</strong>. So sometimes you have to use <strong>be able to</strong> instead.</p>

<ul>
<li>I haven&#8217;t been able to sleep recently. (<strong>can</strong> has no present perfect)</li>
<li>Tom might not be able to come tomorrow. (<strong>can</strong> has no infinitive)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you mean that someone managed to do something in one particular situation, you have to use <strong>was/were able to</strong> (not <strong>could</strong>).</p>

<ul>
<li>The fire spread through the building very quickly but everyone was able to escape. (<em>not</em> <strong>could escape</strong>)</li>
</ul>

<p>We use <strong>needn&#8217;t have</strong> to say that someone did something but it wasn&#8217;t necessary.</p>

<ul>
<li>Thank you for doing the washing-up but you needn&#8217;t have done it really. I was going to do it later.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Need doing</strong> = <strong>need to be done</strong>.</p>

<ul>
<li>The batteries in this radio need changing.</li>
<li>The grass needs cutting.</li>
<li>The jacket needs cleaning.</li>
</ul>

<p>Be careful with <strong>suggest</strong>. You cannot use the infinitive (to do) after <strong>suggest</strong>.</p>

<ul>
<li>What do you suggest we should do? <em>or</em> what do you suggest we do? (but <em>not</em> &#8216;what do you suggest us to do&#8217;)</li>
</ul>

<p>However, you can use <strong>doing</strong> after <strong>suggest</strong>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Tom suggested going to the cinema.</li>
</ul>

<p>When you imagine something not really possible, you use a <em>past</em> tense after <strong>if</strong>. But the meaning is <em>not</em> past. 过去时表达假想一件不可能发生的事情。</p>

<ul>
<li>&#8216;Are you going to catch the 10:30 train?&#8217; &#8216;No. If we caught the 10:30 train, we would arrive too early.&#8217;</li>
<li>If I found 100 Euro in the street, I would keep it.</li>
</ul>

<p>We use <strong>I wish &#8230; would&#8230;</strong> when we want something to happen or somebody to do something. The speaker is complaining about the present situation. So you cannot say &#8216;I wish I would &#8230;&#8217;. 抱怨</p>

<ul>
<li>I want to go out. I wish it would stop raining.</li>
<li>I wish someone would answer that telephone. It&#8217;s been ringing for about five minutes.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can use <strong>would</strong> when you look back on the past and remember things that often happened (= <strong>used to</strong>).</p>

<ul>
<li>When we were children, we lived by the sea. In summer, if the weather was fine, we would all get up early and go for a swim.</li>
</ul>

<p>Do not use <strong>will</strong> after <strong>in case</strong>. Use a present tense when you are talking about the future. 以防</p>

<ul>
<li>John might phone tonight. I don&#8217;t want to go out in case he phones.</li>
<li>Wait. I&#8217;ll draw a map for you in case you cannot find our house.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>In case of</strong> ( = if there is/are) is different from <strong>in case</strong> ( = because it is possible that). 万一</p>

<ul>
<li>In case of fire, please leave the building as quickly as possible.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="if-provided-ing-unless">if, provided/-ing, unless</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Unless</strong> = <strong>except if</strong> 除非</li>
<li><strong>not &#8230; unless</strong> = <strong>only if</strong>. 只有</li>

<li><p><strong>As/so long as</strong> = <strong>provided that</strong> = <strong>providing that</strong> = <strong>but only if</strong> 只要</p></li>

<li><p>Joe cannot hear unless you shout. (Joe can hear only if you shout.)</p></li>

<li><p>You can use my car as long as you drive carefully.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="supposed-to">supposed to</h3>

<p>Sometimes <strong>supposed to</strong> means <strong>said to</strong>. 据说</p>

<ul>
<li>Let&#8217;s go and see that film. It&#8217;s supposed to be very good.</li>
</ul>

<p>But sometimes you can use <strong>supposed to</strong> to say what is planned or arranged. 计划</p>

<ul>
<li>The train was supposed to arrive at 11:30 but it was 40 minutes late.</li>
<li>You were supposed to clean the windows. Why didn&#8217;t you do it?</li>
</ul>

<p>We use <strong>not supposed to</strong> to say what is not allowed or not advisable. 不允许，不建议</p>

<ul>
<li>You are not supposed to park here.</li>
<li>He is much better after his illness but he&#8217;s still not supposed to do any heavy work.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="dare">dare</h3>

<p>After <strong>dare</strong> you can use the infinitive with or without <strong>to</strong>. But after <strong>daren&#8217;t</strong> you must use the infinitive without <strong>to</strong>.</p>

<p>-I wouldn&#8217;t dare (to) ask him.</p>

<p>&#8211; I daren&#8217;t tell him what happened.</p>

<h3 id="be-afraid">be afraid</h3>

<p><strong>Be afraid to do</strong> = do not want to do because the result could be unpleasant. 不敢</p>

<p><strong>Be afraid of doing</strong> = there is a possibility that something bad will happen. 不想</p>

<p>You are afraid to do something because you are afraid of something happening as a result.</p>

<ul>
<li>The boys were afraid to play football in the garden because they were afraid of braking a window.</li>
<li>I was afraid to stay in the sun because I was afraid of getting burnt.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="verb-preposition-doing">Verb + preposition + doing</h3>
