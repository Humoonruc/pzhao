title: The Sound of Science (科学之声)
author: 大鹏
summary: "2月12日是达尔文纪念日。m发给我一个youtube的链接，我一听就笑翻了。有人把老歌&#8217;寂静之声'(The Sound of Silence)歌词改编成了&#8217;科学之声&#8217;（The Sound of Science)，很是有趣。歌词说，&#8217;理论就是我们从科学中所发现的东西背后的规律，就是从我们无尽脑海中抽象出来的系统。'(Because a theory is a system of abstractions in our finite minds, of laws behind the things we find with science.) 能把这句话当成歌来唱的，不是奇才是什么。"

2月12日是达尔文纪念日。m发给我一个youtube的链接，我一听就笑翻了。有人把老歌&#8217;寂静之声'(The Sound of Silence)歌词改编成了&#8217;科学之声&#8217;（The Sound of Science)，很是有趣。歌词说，&#8217;理论就是我们从科学中所发现的东西背后的规律，就是从我们无尽脑海中抽象出来的系统。'(Because a theory is a system of abstractions in our finite minds, of laws behind the things we find with science.) 能把这句话当成歌来唱的，不是奇才是什么。



<span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">这么老的歌吉他谱遍地都是。变调夹夹到自己嗓音合适的位置，选A小调指法。下面的歌词转载自youtube(<a href="http://youtu.be/0TZkKylFHDo">点我</a>)，和弦是我加的。</span>

The Sound of Science

Am                          G
  
Hello Darwin my old friend
  
Am
  
I&#8217;ve come to read from you again
  
F              C
  
You comfort me when I grow weary
  
F              C
  
Of people saying &#8220;it&#8217;s just a theory&#8221;
  
F                                                                      C
  
Because a theory is a system of abstractions in our finite minds
  
Am
  
Of laws behind
  
G            Am
  
The things we find with science.
  
..
  
And on the Internet I saw
  
A billion people, maybe more
  
People clinging to old delusions
  
People jumping to conclusions
  
People holding superstitions that are obviously quite absurd
  
Who&#8217;d never heard
  
A single word of science.
  
..
  
How do you think a doctor knows
  
How a disease like cancer grows?
  
How did we learn how we might treat it?
  
How do you think one day we might beat it?
  
It won&#8217;t be by taking sugar pills or standing on one leg for hours
  
While eating flowers:
  
But through the powers of science.
  
..
  
If you have answers and you&#8217;re sure
  
They&#8217;re better than what came before
  
Make your hypothesis and test it
  
Take the results that you&#8217;ve collected
  
Then you write them in a paper and submit it for a peer review
  
That&#8217;s what we do
  
To check it&#8217;s truly science.
  
..
  
And the people stood and prayed
  
They said &#8220;our faith cannot be swayed&#8221;:
  
They have their views and they won&#8217;t move them
  
They have their truths and they won&#8217;t prove them
  
They&#8217;ll take the words of the prophets over fossils that were really found
  
Beneath the ground
  
They don&#8217;t like the sound of science.
  
(With apologies to Simon and Garfunkel)
