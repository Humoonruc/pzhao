I’m glad to announce that bookdownplus 1.0.2 [@R-bookdownplus] is now on [CRAN]((https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bookdownplus/)).

# Introduction

`R bookdownplus` is an extension of `R bookdown` [@R-bookdown]. It is a collection of
multiple templates on the basis of LaTeX, which are tailored so that I can work happily under the umbrella of `bookdown`. `bookdownplus` helps you write academic journal articles, guitar books, chemical equations, mails, calendars, and diaries.

# Features

`R bookdownplus` extends the features of `bookdown`, and simplifies the procedure. Users only have to choose a template, clarify the book title and author name, and then focus on writing the text. No need to struggle in YAML and LaTeX. 

With `R bookdownplus` users can

-   record guitar chords,
-   write a mail in an elegant layout,
-   write a laboratory journal, or a personal diary,
-   draw a monthly or weekly or conference calendar,
-   and, of course, write academic articles in your favourite way,
-   with chemical molecular formulae and equations,
-   even in Chinese,
-   and more wonders will come soon.

Full documentation can be found in the book [R bookdownplus Textbook](https://bookdown.org/baydap/bookdownplus). The webpage looks so-so, while the [pdf file](https://bookdown.org/baydap/bookdownplus/bookdownplus.pdf) might give you a little surprise.  

# Quick start

Although this section might not be the latest version, the general idea won't change. Please see [R bookdownplus Textbook](https://bookdown.org/baydap/bookdownplus) to keep up with the update.

## Preparation

Before starting, you have to install R, RStudio, bookdown package, and
other software and packages (i.e. Pandoc, LaTeX, rmarkdown, rticle,
knitr, etc.) which bookdown depends on. See the official [manual](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/) of
bookdown for details. Additionall, if you want to produce a poster, phython must be installed before using, and the path of phython might have to be added to the environmental variables for Windows users.

Installation:

```
install.package("bookdownplus")
# or
devtools::install_github("pzhaonet/bookdownplus")
```

Run the following codes, and you will get some files (e.g. `index.Rmd`, `body.Rmd`, `bookdownplus.Rproj`) and folders in your working directory.

```
getwd() # this is your working directory. run setwd() to change it.
bookdownplus::bookdownplus()
```

Now open `bookdownplus.Rproj` with RStudio, and press `ctrl+shift+b` to compile it. Your will get a book file named `*.pdf` in `_book/`folder.

Write your own text in `index.Rmd` and `body.Rmd`, and build your own lovely book.

Have fun!

Still being developed.  Feel free to give your feedback to me!
