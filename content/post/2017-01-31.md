2009年夏，我刚刚出国读书，被系里临时安排在交流学者的办公室。办公室书架上，竖着几本书无人认领，我就顺手牵羊拿走了唯一的一本英文书。此书叫做《English Grammar in Use》，作者是Raymond Murphy，剑桥大学出版社1985年第一版，1988年第八次印刷。扉页上还印着“仅在俄罗斯和乌克兰出售”。20年前的书，难怪闻起来一股古董味。

随手翻了一下，我立刻被吸引住了。这本全部用英文写的语法书，我竟能轻松读懂，顿时很有成就感。书的副标题是“给中级学生的自学参考和练习书”，我不知道自己的水平算不算得上中级，但里面很多小语法点是我的弱项，值得好好学习。此书对语法点没有过多解释，主要是举例子，点到为止，甚合我意。随便摊开，左面一页是语法点和示例，右面一页是习题，两页就是一个单元。每个单元独立成篇，全书共130个单元。前15个单元的习题已经被人用笔写满了，从第16单元，字迹戛然而止。

“虎头蛇尾的家伙。”我暗笑。当时我想，每天做一个单元，5分钟都用不了，那么四个月之后就全部搞定。书从印刷到现在都20年了，书的主人竟然没做完？真瞧不起这种没有自制力的人。

2016年冬，7年多过去了，我……我总算把这本外语书吭哧吭哧读完了。比较一下，大娃京生，7年前只会中文叫“爸爸”，现在能流利地用中文和德语进行日常交流；二娃德生，7年前还在这世上不存在，现在能用中文说“爸爸，你走开，我喜欢妈妈”。而我读一本外语书花了7年多。好吧，自己正是自己瞧不起的那种缺乏自制力的人。

据说，这本书是世界上最受欢迎的中级英语自学语法书。多年来一版再版，甚至还出了配套光盘以及手机上的app。最新版是[第四版][3]，共145个单元，彩色，比我手头这本上世纪80年代黑白印刷的、印刷错误比比皆是的旧书帅多了。我们来感受一下21世纪的时代气息：

而且，网上竟然可以下载得到（点击下载[pdf版][6]、[含光盘版][7]）。此外，该书作者为这本中级语法书写了个姊妹篇给初级用户，叫Essential Grammar in Use（[点击下载][8]）。

这么好的英语书，为什么我年轻时没有接触到？

下面，是我摘录的难点笔记，加上了我的简单注解。一边做笔记一边想，什么中级英语，难度不及我国高考，跟入门级德语的难度相比，更是被完爆……

# English Grammar in Use

by Raymond Murphy

### Present tense with a future meaning 现在时表将来

When you are talking about what you have already arranged to do, use the present continuous (**I am doing**) or **going to do**. Do not use **will**.

  * What are you **doing** tomorrow? (_not_ &#8216;what will you do&#8217;)
  * What are you **going to do** tomorrow?

We use the present simple when talking about timetables, programs etc. (for public transportation, cinemas)

  * The concert this evening **starts** at 7:30.

### Going to, will

We use **going to** in this way when we say what we think will happen. 确定将要发生的事情。

  * Look at those black clouds! It&#8217;s going to rain.
  * Oh, I feel terrible. I think I am going to be sick.

We use **will** when we decide to do something at the time of speaking.

  * Oh, I&#8217;ve left the door open. I&#8217;ll go and shut it.

Do not use **will** to say what someone has already decided to do or arranged to do.

  * I can&#8217;t meet you tomorrow because my parents are coming to see me. (_not_ &#8216;my parents will come&#8217;)

临时起意的计划用will，有“愿意”的意思；蓄谋已久的计划用going to。

We often use **will (you) be doing** to ask about people&#8217;s plan, especially when we want something or want someone to do something.

  * &#8216;Will you be using your bicycle this evening?&#8217; &#8216;No, you can take it.&#8217;

### Present perfect 现在完成时

We often use the present perfect (**I have done**) to give new information or to announce a recent happening.

  * I&#8217;ve lost my key. Can you help me look for it?

**Yet** shows that the speaker is ecpecting sth. to hapen.

  * Has it stopped raining yet?

### Present perfect continuous 现在完成进行时

We use the present perfect continuous (**I have been doing**) when we talk about an action which began in the past and has recently stopped or just stopped or is still happening. 过去开始，最近刚刚结束，或者尚未结束、尚在进行。

  * You&#8217;re out of breath. Have you been running?
  * It is still raining. It has been raining for two hours. (how long, for, since)

We use the present perfect continuous (**I have been doing**) when we are interested in the action. It does not matter whether something has been finished or not. We use the present perfect (**I have done**) when we are interested in the result of the action, not in the action itself. 现在完成进行时关注动作本身，不关心动作是否结束。相反，现在完成时关注动作的结果，不关注动作本身。

  * Tom&#8217;s hands are very dirty. He has been repairing the car. 
  * The car is going again now. Tom has repaired it. 

We use the present perfect continuous (**I have been doing**) for situations over a short time. We use the present perfect (**I have done**) for situations that exist for a longer time. 现在完成进行时用在短时间的情况，现在完成时用于长时间的情况。

  * John has been living in London since January.
  * John has always lived in London.

Do not use the present simple (**I do**) or continuous (**I am doing**) to say how long something has been happening. 表述某件事情发生了多久时，用完成时，不用一般时或进行时。

  * I have been waiting here for an hour. (_not_ &#8216;I am waiting&#8217;)

But:

  * **How long is it since** you had a holiday?
  * **It is ages since** Tom visited us.

### May, might, can, need, should, would, will

We use **may/might as well** to say that we should do something but only because there is no reason not to do it and because there is nothing better to do. 我觉得相当于had better。中文可以翻译成“还是”。

  * You&#8217;ll have to wait an hour for the next bus, so you might as well walk.
  * We may as well go to the party. We&#8217;ve nothing else to do.
  * &#8216;Shall we have dinner now?&#8217; &#8216;We might as well.&#8217;

To give permission, we use **can** or **may** (but _not_ **could**).

  * You can/may smoke if you like.

**Can** has only two forms: **can** and **could**. So sometimes you have to use **be able to** instead.

  * I haven&#8217;t been able to sleep recently. (**can** has no present perfect)
  * Tom might not be able to come tomorrow. (**can** has no infinitive)

If you mean that someone managed to do something in one particular situation, you have to use **was/were able to** (not **could**).

  * The fire spread through the building very quickly but everyone was able to escape. (_not_ **could escape**)

We use **needn&#8217;t have** to say that someone did something but it wasn&#8217;t necessary.

  * Thank you for doing the washing-up but you needn&#8217;t have done it really. I was going to do it later.

**Need doing** = **need to be done**.

  * The batteries in this radio need changing.
  * The grass needs cutting.
  * The jacket needs cleaning.

Be careful with **suggest**. You cannot use the infinitive (to do) after **suggest**.

  * What do you suggest we should do? _or_ what do you suggest we do? (but _not_ &#8216;what do you suggest us to do&#8217;)

However, you can use **doing** after **suggest**.

  * Tom suggested going to the cinema. 

When you imagine something not really possible, you use a _past_ tense after **if**. But the meaning is _not_ past. 过去时表达假想一件不可能发生的事情。

  * &#8216;Are you going to catch the 10:30 train?&#8217; &#8216;No. If we caught the 10:30 train, we would arrive too early.&#8217;
  * If I found 100 Euro in the street, I would keep it.

We use **I wish &#8230; would&#8230;** when we want something to happen or somebody to do something. The speaker is complaining about the present situation. So you cannot say &#8216;I wish I would &#8230;&#8217;. 抱怨

  * I want to go out. I wish it would stop raining. 
  * I wish someone would answer that telephone. It&#8217;s been ringing for about five minutes.

You can use **would** when you look back on the past and remember things that often happened (= **used to**).

  * When we were children, we lived by the sea. In summer, if the weather was fine, we would all get up early and go for a swim.

Do not use **will** after **in case**. Use a present tense when you are talking about the future. 以防

  * John might phone tonight. I don&#8217;t want to go out in case he phones.
  * Wait. I&#8217;ll draw a map for you in case you cannot find our house.

**In case of** ( = if there is/are) is different from **in case** ( = because it is possible that). 万一

  * In case of fire, please leave the building as quickly as possible.

### if, provided/-ing, unless

  * **Unless** = **except if** 除非
  * **not &#8230; unless** = **only if**. 只有
  * **As/so long as** = **provided that** = **providing that** = **but only if** 只要

  * Joe cannot hear unless you shout. (Joe can hear only if you shout.)

  * You can use my car as long as you drive carefully.

### supposed to

Sometimes **supposed to** means **said to**. 据说

  * Let&#8217;s go and see that film. It&#8217;s supposed to be very good.

But sometimes you can use **supposed to** to say what is planned or arranged. 计划

  * The train was supposed to arrive at 11:30 but it was 40 minutes late.
  * You were supposed to clean the windows. Why didn&#8217;t you do it?

We use **not supposed to** to say what is not allowed or not advisable. 不允许，不建议

  * You are not supposed to park here.
  * He is much better after his illness but he&#8217;s still not supposed to do any heavy work.

### dare

After **dare** you can use the infinitive with or without **to**. But after **daren&#8217;t** you must use the infinitive without **to**.

-I wouldn&#8217;t dare (to) ask him.
  
&#8211; I daren&#8217;t tell him what happened.

### be afraid

**Be afraid to do** = do not want to do because the result could be unpleasant. 不敢

**Be afraid of doing** = there is a possibility that something bad will happen. 不想

You are afraid to do something because you are afraid of something happening as a result.

  * The boys were afraid to play football in the garden because they were afraid of braking a window.
  * I was afraid to stay in the sun because I was afraid of getting burnt.

### Verb + preposition + doing

  * I don&#8217;t **feel like** going out tonight. (= would not like to do) 不愿意
  * I&#8217;ve always **dreamed of** being rich. 
  * We **decided against** moving to London.

  * This book **is worth reading**.
  * I had **difficulty (in) finding** a place to live.
  * **It&#8217;s a waste of time/money buying** things you don&#8217;t need.

### Rather

When you want someone else to do something, you can say **I&#8217;d rather you did&#8230;**. We use the past in this structure but the meaning is present or future.

  * I&#8217;d rather you cooked the dinner now.
  * &#8216;Do you mind if I smoke?&#8217; &#8216;I&#8217;d rather you didn&#8217;t.&#8217;

### It&#8217;s time someone did

We use **it&#8217;s time someone did something** especially when we are complaining or criticizing or when we think someone should have already done something. 抱怨

  * It&#8217;s time the children were in bed. It&#8217;s long after their bedtime.
